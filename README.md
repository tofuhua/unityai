# unityai
This is a golang port of Unity2018.3.6f1 AI module.
You should use binary2text provided by Unity to convert the NavMesh.asset from
binary to text format before you dive into this library.
This library provide exact same logic as Unity NavMesh, so you can use it for
your game server, if you are using Unity NavMesh in client.

# Usage
The API is reserved as Unity NavMesh, so it should be convenient to use if you
are familiar with Unity NavMesh API or RecastDetour. If you are not, you may want
to read some examples in test folder.

Thanks
